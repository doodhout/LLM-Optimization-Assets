# Agent Guidelines for LLM-Optimization-Assets

## Project Overview
This is a documentation-only repository containing best practices guides for LLM-assisted development. No code, no build system, no tests.

## Commands
- **No build/lint/test commands** - This is pure Markdown documentation
- To preview locally: Use any Markdown viewer or `mdcat <file.md>`

## Content Style Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Tone**: Professional, evidence-based, practical, actionable
- **Structure**: Use clear hierarchies with H2/H3 headings
- **Length**: Guides typically 200-400 lines; keep content comprehensive but focused
- **Examples**: Always include ✅ Good and ❌ Bad examples with explanations

### Formatting Conventions
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key terms
- Use `code blocks` for file names, commands, and technical terms
- Use blockquotes (>) for key insights and rules
- Include "Why it works:" and "Evidence:" sections to support recommendations
- Start each guide with ## Overview section

### Content Organization
- Place guides in `/guides/<topic>/` directories
- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `context-window-efficiency.md`)
- Reference other guides using relative links: `[Guide Name](../path/to/guide.md)`
- Keep README.md as the central navigation hub

### Quality Standards
- Back all recommendations with evidence (research, community consensus, or real-world usage)
- Be specific and actionable - avoid vague advice
- Include concrete examples for every principle
- Maintain consistency with existing guide structure and tone
